# Easy Loot Sell
osrs runelite plugin for easy identification within loot tabs

How to use it:

1. Install from the runelite plugin hub
2. Enable it and enter which loot tab (Tab 1 - Tab 9) that you are using as a loot tab - do not include the estimated GP value you may see in the tab name (ex: "Tab 9" not "Tab 9 (355k)")
3. Select which color you would like non-zero quantity items to be highlighted in (or "None" to disable this)
4. Select your rearranging options to shift item stacks up and left, closing gaps from hidden items, to make them easier to grab
   1. Tick "Hide Placeholders" if you want to hide all empty item stacks
   2. Tick "Hide Untradables" if you want to hide non-tradable item stacks
   3. Tick "Move Untradables to last" (and un-tick "Hide Untradables") to keep untradables visible, but clearly separated from sellable loot
